# ML-Models-But-From-Scratch
Trying to build popular machine learning algorithms from scratch
## Regression 
### Linear Regression 
This project is the second part of my previous one (https://github.com/abbazsr795/1-Dimentional-Linear-Reggression-With-CPP) where I attempted to build a linear regression model with C++

However the initial model was applicable only for 1 dimensional data. This project uses the knowledge and tools of the previous project along with C++ vectors to make the model applicable to datasets with multiple attributes.

UPDATE 1.0 // Modified the function that produces random data points to be non-linear (added a margin of error to replicate real life datasets). Thank you Savin De Alvis for pointing it out
